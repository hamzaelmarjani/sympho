### Why Sympho?

⏳ Time is the biggest challenge. Many developers want to build an MVP, launch a study project, or release a real AI
Speech solution—but these apps take a lot of time to develop and test. That’s why I created Sympho: to help the
community accelerate their AI Speech projects with a ready-to-use solution.

### Features

- 🎨 **Beautiful & Friendly UI/UX** — built with [Shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/) style.  
  Special thanks to the author of [shadcn_flutter](https://pub.dev/packages/shadcn_flutter) for his great package.

- 📱 **Mobile App Ready to Publish** — for both **iOS** and **Android**.

- 🎵 **Local Audio Storage** — generated audios are stored locally, no need for databases or third-party platforms.

- 🔐 **Secure API Server** — with authentication handling and middleware to verify user tokens.

- 🤖 **ElevenLabs Integration** — seamless AI Speech generation via RESTful API.

- 🗝️ **Environment-Based Security** — use `.env` files to securely store API keys and secrets.

- 🐳 **Docker Support** — prebuilt `Dockerfile` for each API server, deploy with a single command.

- 📖 **Clear Documentation** — even beginners can use the solution without prior knowledge.
