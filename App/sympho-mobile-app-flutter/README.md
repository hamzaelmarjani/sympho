## Usage

1. Install [Dart](https://dart.dev/get-dart) language and set up [](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install)the Flutter environment.

2. Download this [repository](https://github.com/hamzaelmarjani/sympho/), and open it in your work folder; you can use this [tool](https://download-directory.github.io/) to download only a dir without downloading or cloning the whole repository code.

3. Open the folder in your terminal or command line, then open it on your favorite code editor (VScode, Android Studio, etc).

4. Updating Theme: open `lib/data/theme/shadcn.dart` file, and change the `ShadcnThemer` variable to your desired colors, sizes, fonts, etc.
 
5. Updating Voices Male/Female: open `lib/data/voices/male-female/.dart` file, and change `isPro` field to `true` or `false` to make the voice `Pro` or `Free`. **_IMPORTANT_**: Don't change the voice `id` field, otherwise ElevenLabs will not detect this voice.

6. Run your server app. Optional: Update the `baseUrl` variable in `lib/data/urls/server.dart` file with your API server url, default url is `http://localhost:8080` if you didn't change it.

7. **_NOTE_**: If you want to run the app on Android device or emulator, run this command first: `adb reverse tcp:8080 tcp:8080` change 8080 with your API server Port.
